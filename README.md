## 🔬 Research Highlights  

- **[Learning trivializing gradient flows for lattice gauge theories](https://journals.aps.org/prd/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevD.107.L051504)**:  
  We derived a highly efficient Continuous Normalizing Flow for simulating Lattice Gauge Theories. The Model contains all the symmetries of the Theory and set a new state of the art.  

- **Path Gradients**:
  The major focus of my research was on deriving low-variance gradient estimators for Normalizing Flows. We published three papers at [ICML 2022](https://proceedings.mlr.press/v162/vaitl22a.html)(oral), [ICLR 2024](https://openreview.net/forum?id=zlkXLb3wpF&noteId=S0GjQTr3qO), and in [MLST](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/2632-2153/ac9455/meta), with every contribution covering a different aspect from generalizations, thorough analysis and efficient algorithms.
